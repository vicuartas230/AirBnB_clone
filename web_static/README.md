## Description - 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
This project contains the second part of the AirBnB website clone, which consists of a basic visual part with which the user interacts. The project is divided into several html files, in which progress was made in the construction of the web site. The following index will describe the tasks that were accomplished in each file.
### Index
* In the first three files of the project, the body, header and footer tags are used. To style them, the three ways to use CSS are used: styling in the same line of the tag using the style attribute, creating a style tag inside the head tag of the html file and in a different file with .css extension that is then linked using the link tag inside the head tag of the html file.
* In file 3, the objective is to use the icon in the tab and place the logo in the upper left corner, also give the final colors and borders to the header and footer.
* The objective of file 4 is to create a search button inside a container.
* Search filters are created in file 5.
* The idea of file 6 was to create lists that are displayed from the filters when the cursor is hovered over them.
* In file 7 the places to be read by the user are created in separate boxes.
* The boxes that were created in the previous file are updated in file 8, adding the price part, the amenities that each place has and a short description.
